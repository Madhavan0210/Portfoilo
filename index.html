    <h2>about me</h2>
    <p>i am andrew santhosh and i &#10084;&#65039; ai !</p>
    <p>i have a bachelors degree in <b>artificial intelligence and data science</b>&#129302;&#129504;.
        i completed my under grad in 2024. </p>
    <p>i have good knowledge in the field of <b>deep learning</b>.</p>
    <p>i can write code in <b>python, java and c#</b> and i have a good understanding about <b>object-oriented
        programing</b> and <b>asynchronous paradigm</b>.</p>
    <p>my passion for programming began in my late teens which is when i got into <b>computers</b>. i have compiled
        <b>aosp roms</b> for my phones and tablets upstreaming <b>linux kernels</b> for the devices is use.</p>
    <p>i can navigate my way around a <b>&#128039;linux terminal</b> and i know how to <b>git</b>!</p>
    <p>during covid i fumbled my way into <b>python</b> and i got interested in <b>deep learning</b> which is why i
        pursued <b>b.tech</b>&#127891;in ai & ds</p>
    <p>i have used <b>keras, pytorch</b> and <b>&#129303;transformers</b> libraries in many of my projects.</p>
    <p>recently i am experimenting with <b>transformer architecture</b> which is used in <b>language modelling (llm)</b>
        and i have a good understanding about <b>training</b> and <b>fine-tuning</b>
        a language model and i have experience using <b>retrieval augmented generation (rag)</b> with them.</p>

    <h2>projects i have done</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/andrew264/Smol-LM" target="_blank">smol-lm</a>
            <p>in this repository contains all my experiments in language modeling, pre-training, fine-tuning, rag,
                etc...</p>
            <p>includes data processing&#128218;, tokenizer training, tokenization, data preparation, model inference
                code</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/andrew264/Assistant" target="_blank">assistant</a>
            <p>this is my first big passion project that got me deep into coding. this is a discord bot&#129302;.</p>
            <p>this has many features including playing games like tictactoe, rock paper scissor, hand cricket with your
                friends. you can use this to listen to music from youtube and spotify with your friends</p>
            <p>currently i am rewriting this <a href="https://github.com/andrew264/Assistant.Net">bot in c#</a> cuz one
                arsehole convinced me into doing so</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/andrew264/QuickChat" target="_blank">quick-chat</a>
            <p>this is a chat app&#128172; with both client and server that runs in the local network using udp/tcp
                protocols</p>
            <p>it has one big trick up its sleeve, it requires zero configuration from the user, no more entering ip
                addresses into the commandline to connect with other users in the local area network!</p>
            <p>i wrote this in java with gui. i also tried rewriting
                <a href="https://github.com/andrew264/QuickChat-rust" target="_blank">this in rust &#129408;</a> because
                why not! </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/andrew264/palm-control" target="_blank">palm-control</a>
            <p>this is my final year project. it uses google's mediapipe framework&#128075; to control mouse&#128433;&#65039;</p>
            <p>you might have seen a thousand project like this but hear me out, this is not like the rest of them</p>
            <p>it supports mouse acceleration, smoothness control, a gui, ability to switch pointer finger, you can
                drag,
                scroll, control volume, copy, paste, use speech-to-text for keyboard inputs and more...</p>
            <p>heck i even wrote my own app with gui to prepare the dataset required to train the classifier, and wrote
                my
                own neural net architecture that is as small as possible without compromising on model accuracy</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/andrew264/farm-hub" target="_blank">farm-hub</a>
            <p>this is a project i did with my friends for a hackathon. this is a web app that helps young people who
                are new to farming&#129489;&zwj;&#127806;</p>
            <p>you can send a picture of a plant or any infected part of the plant to a language model</p>
            <p>this uses a image classifier behind the scene to help llm see the contents of the image that is attached
                and can help with people</p>
        </li>
